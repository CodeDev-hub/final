        <p>During my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors through hiking and traveling to new places. These experiences allow me to appreciate nature, recharge, and gain new perspectives. I also enjoy swimming and going to the gym, both of which help me stay physically fit and mentally focused. At home, I unwind by playing video games—engaging in strategic gameplay helps me relax, sharpen my thinking, and de-stress after a long day.</p>
